g1 Remove: too short. Length: 5
g2 Remove: too long. Length: 100
g3 Kept, but needed to reverse complement
g4 Does not look like a gene (does not start with start codon, length (9) is not a multiple of 3 (length/3=3.0), or contains internal stop codons). Translation: EEP
g5 Does not look like a gene (does not start with start codon, length (9) is not a multiple of 3 (length/3=3.0), or contains internal stop codons). Translation: M*P
