ARIBA
=====

Antibiotic Resistance Identification By Assembly


For how to use ARIBA, please see the [ARIBA wiki page][ARIBA wiki].



Installation
------------

ARIBA has the following dependencies, which need to be installed:
  * [Python3][python] version >= 3.3.2
  * [Bowtie2][bowtie2] version >= 2.1.0
  * [CD-HIT][cdhit] version >= 4.6
  * [MASH][mash] version >= 1.0.2
  * [MUMmer][mummer] version >= 3.23


Once the dependencies are installed, install ARIBA using pip:

    pip3 install ariba

ARIBA also depends on several Python packages, all of which are available
via pip, so the above command will get those automatically if they
are not installed. The packages are dendropy >= 4.1.0,
pyfastaq >= 3.12.0, pysam >= 0.9.1, and pymummer >= 0.8.1.

Alternatively, you can download the latest release from this github repository,
or clone the repository. Then run the tests:

    python3 setup.py test

If the tests all pass, install:

    python3 setup.py install


### Dependencies and environment variables

By default, ARIBA will look for the dependencies in your `$PATH`, using
the names in the table below. This behaviour can be overridden and
point ARIBA to a specific program using environment variables.
The environment variable is checked first and is used if it is set.
Otherwise ARIBA looks in your `$PATH` for the default name. This applies
to the following dependencies.

| Dependency     |  Default executable    | Environment variable name |
|----------------|------------------------|---------------------------|
| Bowtie2        | `bowtie2`              | `$ARIBA_BOWTIE2`          |
| CD-HIT (est)   | `cd-hit-est`           | `$ARIBA_CDHIT`            |
| CD-HIT (est-2d)| `cd-hit-est-2d`        | `$ARIBA_CDHIT2D`          |
| MASH           | `mash`                 | `$ARIBA_MASH`             |


For example, you could specify an exact version of a bowtie2 executable
that you compiled and downloaded in your home directory (assuming BASH):

    export ARIBA_BOWTIE2=$HOME/bowtie2-2.1.0/bowtie2

Note that ARIBA also runs `bowtie2-build`, for which it uses the
`bowtie2` executable with `-build` appended. So in this case
it would try to use

    $HOME/bowtie2-2.1.0/bowtie2-build


###Â Temporary files

ARIBA can temporarily make a large number of files whilst running, which
are put in a temporary directory made by ARIBA.  The total size of these
files is small, but there can be a many of them. This can be a
problem when running large numbers (100s or 1000s) of jobs simultaneously
on the same file system.
By default, ARIBA creates a temporary directory for these files
inside the output directory of each run.

Each temporary directory
is unique to one run of ARIBA, and is automatically deleted at the end
of the run (even if ARIBA was killed by the user or crashed).
The parent directory of the temporary
directory can be changed using the environment variable
`$ARIBA_TMPDIR`. The temporary directory for each run will be made
inside `$ARIBA_TMPDIR`. For example,

    export $ARIBA_TMPDIR=/tmp

will result in the creation of a new directory inside `/tmp`, which
will have a name of the form

    /tmp/ariba.tmp.abcdef

where the suffix `abcdef` is a random string of characters, chosen
such that `/tmp/ariba.tmp.abcdef` does not already exist.

The temporary directory can also be changed using the option
`--tmp_dir` when running `ariba run`. Using this option takes precedence
over the environment variable `$ARIBA_TMPDIR`. If neither are
set, then ARIBA creates the temporary directory inside
the output directory given to `ariba run`.

The exception to the above is if the option `--noclean` is used.
This forces the temporary directory to be placed in the output
directory, and temporary files are kept. It is intended for
debugging.
